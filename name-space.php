     <h4>
        In PHP, a namespace is a way to group related classes, functions, and constants under a unique name â€” kind of like putting files into folders.

        Avoid name conflicts between classes/functions with the same name in different libraries or parts of your code.

        Help organize code better, especially in large applications.
